The purpose of the paper is to:
- demonstrate a practical application of state-of-art machine learning methods to
extract a rich level of information from historic records
- propose a more detailed model for measuring human capital, which more closely
charts attributes and competencies at the individual level
- say something interesting about economic development in Norway/Scandinavia
during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

As a starting point, a relevant research question could be:
*How did changes in access to education influence the performance of Norwegian students and their career paths?*
This could be further narrowed to consider differences based on gender (to what extent did
male and female students exhibit different trends?) and/or geography (how much of an
effect did proximity to Oslo have?).

## Descriptives
- What trends do we observe in what women study?
- In which fields are women most represented â€” and does this change over time?
- Are there differences in the performance of male and female students by course/field? (For example, are there differences between men and women in the distribution of high school grades at the subject level?)
