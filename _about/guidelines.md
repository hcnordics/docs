Some simple guidelines for management of HCNC and co-authorship

1.	HCNC has a decentralized structure, where PIs of the individual projects/groups are responsible for their own projects, but together comprise the steering committee.
2.	The steering committee meets as necessary to discuss anything necessary for the well-functioning of the entire HCNC project.
3.	The steering committee makes decisions through unanimous decision.
4.	The steering committee organizes an annual workshop for inspiration, information, and coordination.
5.	The steering committee determines matters relating to use of the HCNC database following these guidelines:
    1.	Use of data should at the outset of working on a paper be cleared with those who have collected it, so it can be determined whether acknowledgement or co-authorship is required.
    1.	Data must as a point of departure be shared freely among the various HCNC projects.
    1.	The data will be made public through our Danish and Norwegian partners, following the agreement of the steering committee.
    1.	The data construction team (Danish, Norwegian, or both) must as a point of departure be included as coauthors. They can however choose not to be, and can suggest other members of their teams who should be coauthors.
    1.	If members of the data collection team are not included as coauthors, they should anyway be properly acknowledge/cited.
    1.	Use of related data, in particular the Danish individual level data from Link-Lives and the same for Norway from the Norwegian Historical Data Centre should be acknowledged/cited as per their guidelines.
    1.	Any disputes will be arbitrated by the steering committee.


## Attribution
As a starting point, use of the Danish data should involve Christian MÃ¸ller Dahl, Kristin Ranestad and Paul Sharp as co-authors; use of the Norwegian data should involve the same plus Hilde Sommerseth. However, these individuals may choose not to be co-authors or suggest others from the team who can be co-authors together with them, or instead of them.
