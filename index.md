*Human Capital in the Nordic Countries* is a project to catalogue educational attainment across Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland over the long term. Our goal is to unlock access to an extensive range of detailed student-level information in order to explore the contribution of education to Scandinavia's economic development. We use state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to transcribe historic source material, with this data in turn linked to population-wide registers (such as census records).

The HCNC project is a collaborative endeavour, drawing on researchers at universities and partner institutions in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
