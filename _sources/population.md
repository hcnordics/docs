The digitisation of population-wide resources, such as censuses, is not directly a part of the HCNC project. However, these references are essential for linking the graduates our sources capture across time and place. An overview of the available census records is thus provided here. 

For more details about censuses and related population sources, see:
- Norway: [Historical population register](https://histreg.no/)
- Denmark: [Link Lives](https://link-lives.dk/) and [Link Lives data](https://www.sa.dk/da/brug-arkivet/link-lives-data/) at _Rigsarkivet_
